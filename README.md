# Treasure Box Opening Game Concept

## 1. Overview:
This game offers a total prize pool of **$1000 per round**, and each round is represented by an **NFT Tapp**. The owner of the NFT Tapp can share the Tlink to the game via their Twitter to invite followers to participate. Players need to have the **Tlink extension** installed to participate (main goal: increasing Tlink extension installations). The game features three primary actions, allowing players to open a treasure box, share the game, or purchase more chances using SLN tokens.

## 2. Key Features:

- **NFT Tapp Ownership:** 
  - Each game round is an NFT Tapp, and the person who initiates the game is the Owner of that NFT.
  - Owners can share the game on Twitter using Tlink and earn a share of the revenues generated by participants buying more chances.

- **Prize Pool:**
  - Each round has a total of **$1000** in random prizes.
  - Players can open the treasure box and receive a random amount of prize money.
  - Prizes are small enough to allow for **10,000 attempts** in a single round, ensuring wide participation.

- **Tlink Integration:**
  - **Tlink Extension Installation:** To play, users must install the Tlink extension.
  - **Tlink Sharing:** The NFT Owner can share a Tlink on Twitter to allow others to join the game.

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics:

- **Timed Rounds:** Each game round lasts **60 minutes**. Players have to act quickly within the time limit to open treasure boxes.
  - **Unclaimed Prize Rollover:** If the entire $1000 prize pool is not claimed by the end of the round, the **remaining prize money rolls over** to the next round, increasing the prize pool for the next game.

- **Three Buttons/Cards:**
  1. **Open Treasure Box:** Players can open a treasure box and win a random prize from the $1000 prize pool.
     - Regular players get **1 attempt per round**.
     - **SLN token holders** get additional attempts:
       - SLN holders: **5 attempts per round**.
       - Holders of **$10,000 or more in SLN** get **8 attempts per round**.
     - Extra attempts can be purchased by topping up SLN.

  2. **Share to Earn:** Players can share the game via Tlink on Twitter to earn rewards or invite more players to the game. The rewards for sharing come from the players who purchase extra chances.

  3. **Buy More Chances:** Players can spend **$1 SLN** to get 3 extra attempts. This option automatically buys SLN from **Uniswap** and grants the player more chances to open the treasure box.

- **Randomized Prize Allocation:** Prizes are randomized to ensure that smaller amounts last for 10,000 plays while maintaining fairness.

- **Surge Hour (Bonus Time):** Randomly, a **"Surge Hour"** is declared once a day, where the prize pool is **doubled** or **extra rewards** are available for players. Players who have the Tlink extension installed get notified and can jump into the game.

- **Leaderboard Bonuses:** The **top 3 players** at the end of each round receive bonus rewards based on their participation.

## 4. FOMO Mechanics:

- **Real-Time Progress Bar:** A **live progress bar** shows how much of the $1000 prize pool has been claimed, and a **live countdown timer** displays how many minutes are left in the current round.

- **Limited Availability Alerts:** If a player has not installed the Tlink extension yet, a **pop-up alert** encourages them to install it with urgency, such as “Install Tlink now and join before the prize pool runs out! Only X minutes left!”

- **In-Game Notifications:** Players receive notifications when the prize pool is nearing completion or the round is about to end, encouraging them to purchase more chances or share the game to earn bonuses.

- **Social Sharing Boost:** Each **share on Twitter** could boost the total prize pool by $5 (up to a capped amount), encouraging more social engagement. Players can strategically share the game to increase the rewards available.

## 5. Revenue and Fee Distribution:

- **10% Transaction Fee:** Every time a player purchases extra chances with SLN, a **10% platform fee** is charged. 
  - **9%** goes to the Owner of the NFT Tapp.
  - **1%** goes to the platform.

## 6. User Flow:

1. **Owner Starts a Game:** 
   - The Owner initiates a round with a $1000 prize pool and shares the Tlink via Twitter to invite participants.

2. **Players Join the Game:** 
   - Players must install the Tlink extension to participate. If they haven’t installed it yet, they’ll receive a pop-up prompt.
   - Each player gets one free attempt to open the treasure box. SLN holders receive more attempts.

3. **Buying More Chances:** 
   - Players can buy extra chances by spending **$1 in SLN** for 3 more attempts, automatically processed through Uniswap.

4. **Result Announcement:** 
   - At the end of each 60-minute round, a leaderboard shows the top players, and results are tweeted via **@tBot**.

5. **Leaderboard and Public Results:** 
   - A **real-time leaderboard** tracks the top players during each round, and @tBot publicly announces the results.

6. **Surge Hour:** 
   - Once per day, during **Surge Hour**, players are notified that extra rewards or doubled prize pools are available, driving more engagement.

### **Technical Considerations for Development:**

1. **NFT Minting:** Each game round is minted as an NFT Tapp, owned by the creator.
2. **TokenScript Integration:** Use TokenScript to enable seamless gameplay mechanics, prize distribution, and SLN transactions, with Tlink integration for Twitter sharing.
3. **SLN Transactions:** Players can use SLN to buy more chances directly via Uniswap integration.
4. **Extension Installation Tracking:** Ensure that the Tlink extension must be installed to participate in the game.
